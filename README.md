# Project Summary

In this project, we will be creating practicing manipulating the DOM using vanilla Javascript and an html file.

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository and open the folder in your code editor. You can use live-server to see real-time changes from your code in the browser.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we will create a Javascript file and connect it to our HTML file.

### Instructions

- Create a file called 'index.js'.
- Connect that script file to the HTML page.
  - Feel free to console.log a message to test the connect from your script file.


### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> /index.html </code> </summary>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Tic Tac Toe</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr class="row">
        <td id="0" onclick="play(0)"></td>
        <td id="1" onclick="play(1)"></td>
        <td id="2" onclick="play(2)"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="row">
        <td id="3" onclick="play(3)"></td>
        <td id="4" onclick="play(4)"></td>
        <td id="5" onclick="play(5)"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="row">
        <td id="6" onclick="play(6)"></td>
        <td id="7" onclick="play(7)"></td>
        <td id="8" onclick="play(8)"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <span>Player </span>
    <span id="player">X</span>
    <span>'s turn</span>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```
</details>

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we will reassign value of the "player" from X to O when the board is clicked.

### Instructions
- In index.js, create a function called 'play'. This will be activated when any of the boxes are clicked. 
- In the play function, using 'getElementById', identify the span with the id of 'player'. set that equal to a variable. 
- Using that variable, reassign the content of that element to be 'O' if it is 'X', or vice-versa. 


### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> /index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const play = () => {
  const player = document.getElementById('player');

  if (player.innerText === 'X') {
    player.innerText = 'O';
  } else {
    player.innerText = 'X';
  }
};
```

</details>







## Black Diamond 

Now that we have some basic query examples.  Let's try doing some more complicated ones.
Use [www.sqlteaching.com](http://www.sqlteaching.com/) or [sqlbolt.com](http://sqlbolt.com/) as resources for the missing keywords you'll need.

1. Find the average length of all tracks in milliseconds
2. Find the number of invoices in the USA
3. Make a list of all the First Names of Customers that contain an 'a'
4. Make a list of the 10 longest tracks
5. Make a list of the 20 shortest tracks
6. Find all the customers that live in California or Washington
7. Find all the customers that live in California, Washington, Utah, Florida, or Arizona (Use IN keyword)
8. Insert an artist to the database
9. Insert yourself as a customer to the database
10. Find a list of all Playlists that start with `Classical` 
11. You can either continue exploring this dataset or look into setting up postgres on your local machine.
